# The-Turing-Project

The Turing Test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from that of a human.

It was proposed in 1950 by Alan Turing, a British mathematician and pioneer in computer science, in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence." Instead of asking “Can machines think?”, Turing suggested a more practical question: Can a machine imitate a human well enough to fool another human?

In a world where new large language models are being released even faster than React frameworks, each outperforming the other on some obscure benchmarks set by these AI companies, The Turing Project is an initiative towards **Public Generated Benchmarking (PG-Benchmarking)**, i.e benchmarking done by the public - fully transparent.

The benchmarking criteria is 
> A model's ability to converse like a human

By asking it a fixed set of questions, can we determine if it is a human or an AI based on their responses? Moreover how is the performance of different models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude3, Llama3, Gemini1.5, and many more) on this specific metric.
